<p>The OpenRPC Specification defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification">JSON-RPC 2.0 APIs</a>, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenRPC, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenRPC Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.</p>

<p>Use cases for machine-readable JSON-RPC API definition documents include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>interactive documentation</li>
  <li>code generation for documentation</li>
  <li>clients</li>
  <li>servers</li>
  <li>automation of test cases.</li>
</ul>
